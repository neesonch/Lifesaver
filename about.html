			<h3> Meet the team </h3>
			<p>Team MAC consists of two Project Managers, Michael Coghlan and Maciek Krzycki, two Designers, Pat McCullagh and David Lewis and last but certainly not least one coder, Cormac Neeson. The team embarked on the minor project with fantastic enthusiasm and following a number of both face to face and online brainstorming sessions decided to develop an application that would help people to contact friends and family in case of emergency using their smartphone.</p>
			
			<p>The aptly named application “Life Saver Emergency Button” will be showcased using a new designed responsive website which was developed by the team in order to meet the requirements and criteria of the minor project as part of the <a target ="blank" href ="http://www.digitalskillsacademy.com/"> Digital Skills Academy</a>'s WebInnovate honours degree course.</p>
			
			<p>The team worked well together for the duration of the project and successfully developed the final responsive website within the time limits set down overcoming a number of difficulties on the way. It can be said that the team enjoyed the development process and all the team members regardless of their preferred stream have pulled together to successfully complete the project and all have expressed an interest in working together again in the near future.</p>

		<h4>Maciek Krzycki</h4>
		<h5>P.M.</h5>
		<p>I can describe myself as a TED & Star Trek lover, espresso connoisseur, technology follower, digital native, Google AdWords and Analytics passionate, digital marketing and SEO techniques user, half humanist half analyst with good balance between brain and heart.</p>
		<p>Apart from "professionally unique personality" - I have over 10 years of work experience in:<br><br>
		- Project Management | Analysis<br><br>
		- Digital Marketing & SEO<br><br>
		- CRM | consultative sales | relationships<br><br>
		- Supply chain & fulfillment management<br><br>
		
		And I feel equally well as part of the process associated with project management, the supply chain, the link between the supplier and the consumer in customer relations or the provider and executive of marketing solutions.

		<h4>Cormac Neeson</h4>
		<h5>Coder</h5>
		<p>I completed a history degree at Trinity college and after graduating spend a year working at IBM. After it became apparent that a history degree was of very little practical use outside the halls of academia, I turned my attention to web development and programming. I went back to Trinity and achieved an M.Sc. in Interactive Digital Media, and I hope to further my skills and experience in this area through my participation in the Digital Skills Academy.</p>
